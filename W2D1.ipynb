    "## Day 1 – Order Book Refactor & Performance Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this task was to refactor the Week 1 order book implementation to use a heap-based data structure and to evaluate its performance against a list-based approach. This experiment aims to justify the use of priority queues in exchange systems where low-latency order insertion is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refactor Summary\n",
    "In Week 1, orders were stored in Python lists and sorted to determine priority. While functionally correct, this approach requires re-sorting the list on every insertion, leading to poor scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, the order book was refactored to use the `heapq` module:\n",
    "- Buy orders (bids) were stored in a max-heap (simulated using negative prices).\n",
    "- Sell orders (asks) were stored in a min-heap.\n",
    "- Heap entries were structured to enforce price–time priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "This refactor preserves correctness while significantly improving insertion efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "To compare performance, the time taken to insert 10,000 orders was measured for both implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple `Order` object was used with price and timestamp fields.\n",
    "- Orders were generated with random prices within a fixed range.\n",
    "- For the list-based order book, each insertion was followed by sorting.\n",
    "- For the heap-based order book, orders were inserted using `heapq.heappush`.\n",
    "- Only insertion time was measured; no matching logic was included.\n",
    "- Timing was recorded using `time.perf_counter()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Structure | Time to Insert 10,000 Orders |\n",
    "|---------------|-----------------------------|\n",
    "| List-based    | Significantly slower        |\n",
    "| Heap-based    | Significantly faster        |\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap-based implementation consistently outperformed the list-based approach by a large margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The experiment demonstrates that list-based order books do not scale well due to their O(n log n) insertion behavior caused by repeated sorting. In contrast, heap-based order books maintain priority with O(log n) insertion time, making them far more suitable for exchange and high-frequency trading systems. This result justifies the architectural shift to heaps in the Week 2 market engine.\n"
